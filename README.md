- 👋 Hi, I’m @KingpenguinL
- 👀 I’m interested in penguins, among other things.
-  I’m currently learning PHP, SQL, Java, JS, HTML/CSS, C++, C#, json, XML and Python (recently LUA too).
- I’m looking to collaborate on basic projects for now to build a portfolio and gain experience
- How best to reach me: Discord or Reddit (of the same handle).
